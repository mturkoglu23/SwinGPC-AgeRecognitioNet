# SwinGPC-AgeRecognitioNet
In the fishing industry, accurately determining the age of fish is of critical importance for sustainable management and the conservation of resources. This study introduces a new method for determining the ages of Mediterranean mackerel fish: SwinGPC-AgeRecognitionNet. This approach aims to accurately predict the ages of fish using a Swin Transformer-based deep learning model along with a Gaussian Process classifier utilising otolith images. In the first stage of the study, a feature extraction process is performed using the Swin Transformer network to process otolith images. This specialized network stands out for its ability to handle the complexity of images and different data scales. The features obtained through this process are then subjected to feature selection to identify effective and meaningful ones. In the final step, these selected features are fed into the input of the Gaussian Process classifier, and age estimation is performed. In addition, an optimization algorithm is used to obtain the best results for this classification method. The experimental results demonstrate that SwinGPC-AgeRecognitionNet achieves high accuracy rates in determining the ages of Mediterranean mackerel fish. This method is more precise and reliable than traditional approaches, making a significant contribution to the sustainable use of resources in the fishing industry. In conclusion, this article showcases the significant advancement that SwinGPC-AgeRecognitionNet offers in the field of fish age determination, potentially becoming a valuable tool in the management of fish stocks in the future.
